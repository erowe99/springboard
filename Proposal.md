## **Capstone Proposal**: Perceivant Student Engagement Data

The client for my capstone project is Perceivant. Perceivant provides online courseware to universities and focuses on active learning. Active learning is tailored to the individual student and is meant to involve students in the learning process. The goal is that students can apply what they learn in these courses.

Perceivant wants to identify which factors of student engagement determine success in a course. They also want to see if there are other factors that predict failure. Being able to determine which students are at risk is critical for Perceivant to help them before they fail(Is this why, or is there another reason?). Perceivant will use the results to brainstorm potential ideas to boost student engagement based on the success factors and create risk assessments based on predictive failure factors. (This will be useful to Perceivant because....).

The data for this project will be provided by Perceivant and is gathered through its online courseware. The data will focus on one course from one university. This is about 1300 entries containing various factors such as de-identified student grades, engagement, click history, and assessment responses.

I will finish the project by presenting the analysis to Perceivant. This will require a slide deck and a written report for them to reference. Along with this, I will provide the code for the project on Github.

(This is a little too short and vague for me. I still do not feel like I have a good idea of what I am doing. What is driving Perceivant to solve this problem, what is the danger of it not being solved? I also do not feel like I described Perceivant very well, but it is really the problem definition that is bothering me. Why is this a problem? What is the current situation? How would this analysis improve it? What are the risk assessments? what are the predictive failure rates? what is a measure for student engagement that Perceivant uses the most, like attendance, click history, time spent, grades, etc.? what is it?)
